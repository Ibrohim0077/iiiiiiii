        <p class="tex2">We’re built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good along the way. We want to make it easy for you
            to discover and brew the world’s best coffee at home. It all starts at the source. To locate the specific
            lots we want to purchase, we travel nearly 60 days a year trying to understand the challenges and
            initiatives, and invest in coffee plant science. Curating only the finest blends, we roast each lot to
            highlight tasting profiles distinctive to their native growing region.</p>
